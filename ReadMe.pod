Jq == <<<cpan-head>>>

=head1 Synopsis

C<>C< my @inc = jq '.' @INC; my $paths = jq 'keys' \%INC; >C<>

=head1 Description

Jq is a data language for querying and manipulating JSON data. It takes JSON
as input; queries and manipulates; and then prints JSON as output.

Jq.pm is a Perl module binding to Jq. Its inputs and outputs are Perl data
objects that can be represented as JSON.

=head1 Status

The current version of Jq uses IPC::Run to invoke your local C<jq> binary.
This is an API compatible workaround until we can get the XS bindings working.
